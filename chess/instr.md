How to play parallel chess:
1 Each player nominates a move without the other player knowing.
** This can be a direct move (possible on the current board) or a speculative move (not possible currently, but would be made possible if the other player moved in a certain way)
** All the normal chess movement rules apply, with the capturing of kings being explicitly forbidden
2 * If the nominated moves can be independently made, they are made and the game proceeds.
  * If the nominated moves can be made in a specific order, they are made in that order and the game proceeds.
  * [NOT IMPL] If the nominated moves can be made in either order but would lead to different results, and those results differ only by the capturing of one or the other of the pieces that moved, both pieces are captured and the game proceeds
    * [HARDCORE MOD FUTURE] Variant: The lower-valued piece captures the higher-valued piece
  * [BAN NOT IMPL] If both moves are speculative, they are canceled and banned from the next nomination
  * [BAN NOT IMPL] If one move is direct and one is speculative (and cannot be made), the speculative move is canceled and banned from the next nomination
  * [NOT IMPL] If both moves are direct and consist of two pieces capturing each other, the two pieces are captured and the game proceeds
    * [HARDCORE MOD FUTURE] Variant: The lower-valued piece captures the higher-valued piece
  * [BAN NOT IMPL] Otherwise the two moves (which are direct but cannot be made) are canceled and banned from the next nomination
3 The game ends when only the kings are left or when a player has no direct moves left
  * [Challenge: is it possible to double-checkmate?]
